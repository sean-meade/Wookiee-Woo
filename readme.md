## Color Scheme

In designing the color palette for this project, a tertiary color wheel analysis approach was utilized. This method involves selecting a primary color, then finding secondary and tertiary colors that complement and enhance the overall aesthetic. Here's a breakdown of how the colors were chosen and their roles in the design:

### Colors Used

- **Primary Color: #cf4f50 (Red)**
  - This vibrant red serves as the main highlight color, providing energy and focus to key elements.
  
- **Secondary Color: #243145 (Blue)**
  - The deep blue acts as a strong, stable base color, suitable for backgrounds, text, and other primary elements.
  
- **Tertiary Color: #ecc6c6 (Light Pink)**
  - A soft pastel pink was chosen as a tertiary color to create harmony and add a gentle, complementary touch to the palette.
  
- **Neutral Color: #f5f5f5 (Light Gray)**
  - Light gray is used as a neutral background to keep the design clean and unobtrusive, allowing other colors to stand out.
  
- **Complementary Color: #ff9800 (Orange)**
  - Orange was selected as a complementary color to the blue, adding warmth and creating a striking contrast when needed.
  
- **Analogous Color: #ff6f61 (Coral)**
  - Coral, an analogous color to the primary red, provides additional variety and can be used for accents to maintain visual cohesion.
